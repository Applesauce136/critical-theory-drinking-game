# It's the Critical Theory Drinking Game!

Hit "roll" to get a random critical theory, plus a famous work to go along with it.  Then you have to think of a thesis to accompany it.  If you think of a shitty one, you have to take a drink; but if yours is funny or insightful or both, everyone else does!

You can decide amongst yourselves what a good theory is.  That's not my job.

Happy analysis!
